# tradingsolver

Selenium-based program that solves high-speed maths challenges. On my local system gets a score of 1150 on zetamac.com (non-headless) on Windows and a score of 3306 (headless) on Linux (so almost 3 times faster!). Not the most efficient configuration possible, and higher scores can be achieved with a faster CPU or some optimisation.
